# GridLang

(Note: GridLang name is a placeholder and this readme is a stub)

GridLang is a library for building 2-dimensional domain specific languages designed to be edited in a Spreadsheet UI.

Unlike traditional computer languages that parse tokens in-order, tokens in GridLanguages are parsed in a lazy, non-linear manner, based upon there position in a 2-d matrix.

Our "Explorer"—a DSL for building OWID explorers and Graphers—is a GridLang.

GridLangs are also intrinsically "patchable"—a great way for perserving user state.

## How it works

1. Extend the base GridProgram class with a class for your new DSL.
2. Create a grammar for your DSL.
3. Load in some "programs" from TSVs.

## Patch: encoding all Query Params as a single TSV document

Patch is a simple design pattern for allowing users to easily store all their state—"just throw it in the patch"!

Quick example:

Instead of turning this:

```json
{
    "selection": ["USA", "Canada"],
    "year": 2000,
    "tab": "map"
}
```

into this:

```
country=USA~Canada&year=2000&tab=map
```

Turn this:

```tsv
selection	USA	Canada
year	2000
tab	map
```

into this:

```
patch=selection-is-USA~Canada-and-year-is-2000-and-tab-is-map
```

Tabs become "-is-"
Newlines become -and-"

(But the delimiters are params that you can define yourself)

## Benefits

1. A single place to encode and decode your params. Just encode/decode the whole patch. Do not decode/encode N times for every parameter nor invent a special encoding scheme for each param.
2. Cleanly encodes arrays and nested structures.
3. Improved human readability for short params; greatly improved readability for complex params.
4. Versioning with easy upgrading.
5. Very easy to debug—it's just a patch!

## How to use

1. Patch comes in handy when you have GridLangs that:

-   have state
-   that the user can change
-   that the user should be able to take with them and rehydrate the class with

2. Bind your patch to the window.

## Versioning

Just use semantic versioning, only caring about breaking changes so only a major version:

patchVersion=2&patch=...
